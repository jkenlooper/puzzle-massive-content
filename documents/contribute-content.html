Hi.  My name is Jake Hickenlooper and I've built this Puzzle Massive website for
fun and frustration <code>;)</code> .  Well, sometimes it can be frustrating in
a fun way.  It is something that I enjoy doing and want to share it with whoever
would appreciate it.  The best way to keep the project successful is with the
help from
wonderful people <!-- Shout out to Anton Petrov's YouTube channel -->
like yourselves.
</p>

<p>
There are <strong>many ways</strong> to help with the Puzzle Massive project.
Just like the jigsaw puzzles it hosts, it is a collaborative effort and has many
ways that it can be improved.  I want this project <em>to continue</em> to be
available to anyone that enjoys doing online jigsaw puzzles.

    You good with words?  Great! this sentence could probably maybe use some
    helps and stuffs like that...as well as other places on the site.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning how to program or just want to dive into a new and strange code
    base?  Well, make a fork of the Puzzle Massive code and get it running on
    your own local machine.  Please ask questions on the Discord chat
    channel.  Or maybe start a topic on this
    <a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive/discussions">discussion board</a>.

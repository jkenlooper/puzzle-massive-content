  A puzzle instance slot is filled with a copy of an existing puzzle. When that
  puzzle is completed it can then be deleted which will allow the player to pick
  a new puzzle to fill the puzzle instance slot. The player can share the link
  to the puzzle with friends or have it listed on the site publicly. At anytime,
  the player can freeze the puzzle which will prevent anyone from moving pieces
  until the player unfreezes it.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create your own private or public puzzles from existing ones.</li>
  <li>
    Set the piece count to how ever many pieces you'd like (limited by image
    size).
  </li>
  <li>Share the link to your puzzle with your friends.</li>
  <li>
    Freeze the puzzle pieces at anytime preventing others from moving them.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Puzzle Instance Slots are available for sale at the
  <a href="https://puzzle-massive.square.site/"
    >Puzzle Massive store hosted on Square</a
  >. It can take a day or so to manually assign them to your player account
  after purchase. I plan to automate this better in the future.

  Sponsor my open source work on the

  <p>
    Here are some made up Frequently Asked Questions concerning this jigsaw
    puzzle website.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>How do you prevent other players from messing up the pieces?</dt>
    <dd>
      Players earn karma points for joining pieces on a puzzle. These points are
      temporary and only apply to each puzzle. Moving larger groups of pieces
      deduct these points as well as stacking pieces and other things. If a
      player gets too low of karma points they are temporarily blocked from
      moving any more pieces on that puzzle.
    </dd>

    <dt>The puzzle page doesn't show any pieces.</dt>
    <dd>
      Most likely because the web browser being used is not supported. Please
      use a more recent version. Supporting less capable browsers is not a top
      priority at this point.
    </dd>

    <dt id="puzzle-massive_faqpage-content_browser-support">
      What browsers are supported?
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Only recent versions of Google Chrome, Safari, and FireFox are supported.
      iPhones and iPads running recent version of iOS are also supported. Other
      touch screen devices that run Android and have the Google Chrome browser
      should work. I mostly play on a Google Nexus phone which works pretty well
      on the smaller puzzles.
    </dd>

    <dt>Are there any keyboard keys assigned?</dt>
    <dd>
      Only the full scale puzzle has keyboard keys assigned to aid navigating
      around a puzzle. I haven't implemented keyboard navigation on the scaled
      down view of the puzzle.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong
            ><code>w</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>s</code>, and
            <code>d</code> keys</strong
          >
          will scroll jump in that direction (up, left, down, right)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            ><code>shift</code> + <code>0</code> - <code>9</code> keys</strong
          >
          set a jump point
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>0</code> - <code>9</code> keys</strong> scroll to a set
          jump point
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>z</code> key</strong> will go back to the previous
          scroll position after going to a jump point
        </li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>
      The design and the user interface for the puzzle page changed. Why?!
    </dt>
    <dd>Change is good, and I sometimes break stuff.</dd>
    <dd>
      Read the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md"
        >changelog for this project</a
      >.
    </dd>

    <dt>This project is open source?</dt>
    <dd>
      It didn't start off as an open source project when I first started it in
      2011. I have recently moved it to being an open source project under the
      GNU Affero General Public License. I also decided to not include the past
      git commit history in order to clean up things. Pull requests are welcome.
      See the link to the project in the footer.
    </dd>

    <dt>What software stack did you use?</dt>
    <dd>
      Mostly built with python on the server side;
      <a href="/credits/#puzzle-massive-software-stack"
        >more detail about the stack</a
      >
      is on the credits page.
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I create my own puzzle?</dt>
    <dd>
      You can
      <a href="/chill[chill page_uri new-puzzle/submit]">submit a picture</a>
      that you would like to become a jigsaw puzzle.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      You can also create copies (instances) of existing puzzles if you have an
      open puzzle slot. Puzzle slots are mostly a paid for feature and can be
      assigned to your player account.
    </dd>

    <dt>Bit Icon?</dt>
    <dd>
      I suppose this is my own made up thing. The idea is that a <em>bit</em> is
      like a game piece that is used to signify you as a player. Like being the
      horse or hat in Monopoly. For Puzzle Massive a bit icon is a somewhat
      temporary identity that is used while playing. Inactive players will have
      their bit icon recycled.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      These icons are made by these two artists:
      <a href="/credits/#icon-artist-martin-berube">Martin Berube</a>
      and
      <a href="/credits/#icon-artist-mackenzie-deragon">Mackenzie Deragon</a>. I
      will eventually add more in the future.
    </dd>

    <dt>How to login or signup?</dt>
    <dd>
      It is not required to register a player account in order to play. By
      default, any new players are automatically assigned a new player account
      based on their network. They are then logged in with a web browser cookie.
      Players have the option to register their player account with an e-mail
      address which will allow them to login by e-mail.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      Players that have claimed their player account have the option to login by
      using the anonymous login link. This link is created on the player profile
      page.
    </dd>

    <dt>Where are the ads?</dt>
    <dd>I think most people don't like ads, including me.</dd>

    <dt>How is the project funded?</dt>
    <dd>
      You can sponsor my open source work on the
      <a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive"
        >Puzzle Massive project</a
      >. Any of the sponsor tier levels will get at least one puzzle instance
      slot.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      I manually assign puzzle slots to players that have helped fund the
      project. I'll eventually have an automated way for players to be awarded these
      puzzle slots (See <a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive/issues/87">issue #87</a>).
      A player with a puzzle slot can create copies of existing
      puzzles that they can control who has access to them.

    </dd>
    <dt>What is a puzzle slot and puzzle instance?</dt>
    <dd>
      Players can create copies of existing puzzles that they can control who
      has access to them. A player can only create a copy (instance) of a puzzle
      if they have a puzzle slot that is open. Puzzle slots are only assigned to
      player accounts manually by me. At this point it is not an automated
      process to get puzzle slots.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      Players that sponser me on the
      <a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive"
        >Puzzle Massive project</a
      >
      are rewarded with a puzzle slot.

  Check out the

    >Puzzle Massive project on GitHub</a
  >. If you have ideas on how to improve the site, or see something that can be
  improved, then create an issue there. I would also love help with other
  aspects to the site like design, or copy and documentation and such. For those
  that have some background in web development (or want to learn) you can get a
  local version of Puzzle Massive running on your machine.

<h2>The <s>boring</s> history of the project</h2>

<p>
  The idea of an online multiplayer jigsaw puzzle is quite simple; drag a piece
  from one location to another, see that change happen for everyone else viewing
  the page. Right, so you save the coordinates after the player moves the piece
  and publish that to all of the players that are subscribed to that jigsaw
  puzzle. Handle the complexity of joining pieces... somehow. Oh, and each
  puzzle piece shape should be randomly generated. Which also means that players
  should have the ability to create puzzles from any picture they want. Throw in
  some quick thread handling, so the web application can continue serving
  requests while a puzzle is generating... and well, it's no longer a simple
  application.
</p>

<p>
  So, this all started around 2011 as a side project. It's been through a few
  revisions, but still carries some old ways of doing things. The project is now
  getting more attention as I'm improving the user interface as well as the
  server side code.
</p>

<p>
  I am still working on this as a side project and work on it when I can. The
  <a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive/labels/feature"
    >upcoming feature list</a
  >
  is like a massive jigsaw puzzle that I enjoy working on. Some pieces are
  simple to join together, and others require more effort.
